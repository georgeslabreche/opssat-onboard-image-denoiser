## Training
- This folder contains the source codes to train the Autoencoder and WGANs models.
- The WGANs source code is included as a git submodule that is fetched from [this repo](https://github.com/georgeslabreche/opssat-onboard-image-denoiser-wgans).

## Todo
1. Implement script to fetch and prepare the training data.
2. Put Autoencoder source code inside its own repository (like WGANs).
3. Write instructions on how to fetch the WGANs git submodule.
